## üöÄ Installation

4. Run the updater:

## üíª Usage

When you first run the tool, it will guide you through the configuration process:

1. **Profile Configuration**: Set up one or more mod folder profiles
   - Enter a name for each profile (e.g., "client", "server", "fabric115")
   - Specify the path to the mod folder for each profile (relative or absolute)
   - Choose which profile should be active by default

2. **Game Settings**:
   - Set your Minecraft game version(s)
   - Specify your mod loader(s) (fabric, forge, quilt)

3. **Update Settings**:
   - Choose whether to automatically update mods
   - Enable/disable backups before updating
   - Set the update check interval

After configuration, use the main menu to:
- Check for updates for any of your configured profiles
- Modify your configuration settings
- Exit the application

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The configuration is stored in `mod_updater_config.json` and includes:

- `mod_folders`: Dictionary of profile names and their mod folder paths
- `current_folder`: The active profile
- `game_versions`: List of Minecraft versions to check for updates
- `loaders`: List of mod loaders (fabric, forge, quilt)
- `auto_update`: Whether to update mods automatically
- `backup_mods`: Whether to create backups before updating
- `check_interval_days`: How often to check for updates (in days)
- `last_check`: When the last update check was performed

## üìù How It Works

The updater works by:

1. Calculating unique hashes for each mod file
2. Querying the Modrinth API to identify the mods and their current versions
3. Checking if newer versions are available for your specified game version and mod loader
4. Downloading and replacing outdated mods with their newest versions

## üîí Privacy & Security

- This tool only communicates with the official Modrinth API
- No personal data is collected or transmitted
- All operations are performed locally on your machine

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **Mod Not Updating**: The mod might not be hosted on Modrinth, or the hash might not be recognized
- **Update Errors**: Make sure you have write permissions to the mod folder
